## What is game design?

Creating:

* content and rules of a game
* goals a player is motivated to reach
* rules to make decisions meaningful

### It's also  all about the player

Gameplay itself inherently motivates the player in the direction the designer wants them to go
(as opposed to demanding player do something via the rules).

Think about the player's perspective:

* What's thsi game about?
* How do I play?
* How do I win?
* Why do I want to play?
* What things do I need to do?

### Meaningful decisions

> game design is about creating opportunities for players to make meaningful decisions that affect the outcome of the game.

-- page 2

> Whenever the player is allowed to exercise choice in a game and that choice affects the outcome of the game, then designers are creating _meaning._ In order to create choice, there has to be another option that has meaning as well.

## What game design is not

* The game's art
* Any programming that implements the game

## Types of design

* **World design** -- backstory, setting, theme
* **System deisgn** -- rules and underlying mathematical patterns (ch 2, 5, 6, 7, 8)
* **Content design** -- characters, items, puzzles, missions (ch 3, 9, 10, 19, 20)
* **Game writing** -- dialogue, text, and story (ch 9)
* **Level design** -- layout of maps, placement of objects and challenges
* **User interface** -- how the player interacts with the game and how the player receives information and feedback (ch 17, 18)

## What is a game?

## The core of a a game

The single thing gameplay is about. Usually tied to a "core mechanic",
which leads to a "core dynamic" (particular pattern of play).
"Core statementes" (sometimes called the "vision") reflect the core mechanic
and dynamic, and sum up what the game is about.

* "This game is about..."
* "This game is the experience of being..."
* "This game teaches..."
* "This game simulates the experience of..."

Common core dynamics:

* **Territorial Acquisition** -- zero-sum territory ownership, controlling a piece of territory (Risk, Othello)
* **Prediction** -- Doing the right thing at the right time (rock-paper-scissors)
* **Spatial Reasoning** -- Where a piece fits in, the implications on future pieces (Tetris, Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four)
* **Survival** -- ??
* **Destruction** -- wreck-everything-in-sight (Lego Star Wars, every FPS)
* **Building** -- developing a character or structure (RPGs, Sim City)
* **Collection** -- matching similar objects together, collecting coins/rings/cards
* **Chasing or Evading** -- (Pacman, Scotland Yard)
* **Trading** -- cooperating with other players to trade for relatively beneficial resources (Pit, Settlers of Catan, Pokemon)
* **Race To The End** -- First player to cross a finish line

A **feature set** is implemented from the core mechanic.


## Where do ideas come from?

> Anything at all -- can be turned into a game. From bean farming, to sheep herding

-- page 9

Here are common places people get ideas:

* **Playing lots of games** -- allows you to see what others are coming up with
* **Networking with other designers** -- gets the creative juices flowing
* **Everywhere** -- just pay attention to your surroundings

My thought: Anything that requires a skill is a game, whether it's thought of
that way or not.


## Learning game design

Learn by doing: create games.


## Common terms in Game design

* **Feature List** -- key features / selling points of a game (typically found on the back of the box)
* **Brainstorming** -- Generate ideas by calling out any idea that occurs to you, no matter how crazy. No criticisms during this phase.
* **Prototype** -- playable early version of the game.
* **Balance** -- consistent challenge (not too easy/hard/biased for one team), cost of obtaining an item is congruent with its benefit.
* **Mechanics** -- Rules for how to play the game (trick taking, rolling a die, moving)
* **Dynamics** -- patterns of play that emerge from the mechanics (e.g. mechanic is spawning players at certain locations, dynamic is spawn camping)
* **System** -- Collection of mechanics responsible for producing an outcome wihtin a larger game (e.g. character creation, combat, casting spells)
* **Avatar** -- direct representation of a player (shoe in Monopoly, Lara Croft in Tomb Raider)
* **Playtesting** -- systematic testing of these elements to find imbalances, inconsistencies, or issues
* **Platform** -- Console, device, or system it will be played on
* **Concept Doc** -- one to three page document that provides a high-level overview of a proposed game. Usually contains an introductory paragraph explaining the theme; demographic breakdown including target audience, genre, intended platforms; bullet-point feature list; feature details;
* **Proposal** -- A 5-20 page document that provides provides a more in-depth view of the potential game than a concept document. (page 13 for more details)
* **Pitch** -- "elevator speech" you'd give to a publisher.
* **Design Document** -- ??
* **Engine** -- Core program that runs the game (e.g. Unreal)
* **Alpha** -- Milestone at which all systems have been implemented and all code is theoretically complete.
* **Beta** -- Milestone at which all systems and content are in the game
* **Gold** -- Final version of the game that is then released
* **Game Jam** -- timed period where people attempt to create a complete game while working around the clock (hackathon)
* **Game Bits** -- The informal name given to the pieces and parts that ship with a game (tiles, cards, etc)


## Approaches to game design

* **Blue Sky** -- Come up with whatever you want, there are no restrictions
* **Slow Boil** -- Given a theme / setting, learning as much about it as possible and seeing what emerges
* **Mechanic** -- Deriving games based on the mechanic (e.g. Mario is about running, jumping, etc, and all its levels and sub-games come out of this mechanice)
* **MDA** -- Using "Mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics" model, where you're thinking about the dynamics that emerge from the mechanics, and the aesthetics (emotional response players have as a consequence of the dynamics), start at the end (first determine aesthetics, then dynamics to achieve them, then mechanics to achieve these)
* **IP** -- "Intellectual property", building a game on a pre-existing game (e.g. a game franchise like Madden)
* **Story** -- Developing a game based on a story (e.g. game from book)
* **Research** -- Using a game as a way to research a topic (as you might a documentary or a report)


## Iterative design

Basically Agile as applied to game design: Rapidly Prototype, playtest, revise, repeat.

Focus on fixing issues so you don't get band-aids applied to band-aids.


## Constraints on game design

Video game constraints: Budget, timeframe, platform, target audience, rating, genre, features.
Non-digital constraints: const to manufacture, physical dimensions, publisher, timing.


## Overcoming designer's block

* Make a resource limited (or unlimited)
* Interacting with your friends
* Mess with the play order
* Kill a rule
* Use the "Rule of Two"
