# Iron designer challenge 5: War Without Frontiers (page 39)

In games featuring the territorial acquisition dynamic, and especially in war-themed games,
territories are rarely acquired through a comical foot race.
They're usually acquired through the death, regardless of how abstracted, of another player's bits.
As a result of that death, the player gets the other player's territory.
Whoever has the territory wins the war.
Another common dynamic, "destroy the opposing side," is used for games that don't have territory.

For ths exercise, however, you'll be punishing yourself beyond those traditional borders.
Simulate and resolve a Civil War battle _without_ using territorial acquisition or
destruction of all units on the enemy side as the primary gameplay dynamic.

Split into teams of two to four players.
Each team should do its best to come up with a game that fits the above constraints.
For a greater challenge, have each team choose an additional mechanic or dynamic
that the other team is not allowed to use.

## Components Required

* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable

* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype

## Suggested Process

1. **Determine a theme.** Which battle does your game simulate?
2. **Identify mechanics.** Without territorial acquisition, does it make sense to even have territory?
   It might, or it might not. Consider how a player can win a battle other than claiming territory.
   What is the goal, if not territory? What kinds of mechanics can players perform to achieve that goal?
3. **Identify the conflict between players.**
4. **Playtest.** Every time you add a mechanic to the game, test it.
5. **Create deliverable**

## Variants

Instead of the Civil War, choose a different conflict. World Wars I and II are obvious choices. You could also use other conflicts like corporate acquisition, feuding neighbors, or competing chain stores.
