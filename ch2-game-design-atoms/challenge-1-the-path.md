# Challenge 1: The Path (page 35)

For this game, you are going to explore the race to the end gameplay dynamic discussed earlier.
The game should allow two to four players, be about progressing on a path,
and make them go from point A to point B. The first player to point B wins.

As the game's designer, it's up to you to figure out the theme, the game bits, and the mechanics.

## Components Required
* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable
* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype or
* One-page write-up of detailing a potential game design

## Suggested Process
1. **Determine a theme and a goal.** Where are the players going,
   and why are they going there? Choose a theme that involves some interaction between the participants, to make things interesting.
2. **Identify mechanics.** Start simple. Visualize a track that goes from beginning to end that's broken up into a bunch of different sections.
   It may be 100 spaces or tiles or cards that ultimately build the track on which your players are going to "race."
   Now think of the mechanic that will get your players moving on that track. The simplest one is rolling a die.
   Next consider things you could do to make play more interesting. For instance, you could have an action that speeds you up or slows your opponent down.
   Does the narrative suggest any obvious mechanics? For example, if your game is about a relay foot race,
   you'll need a way to pass the baton (perhaps suggesting a tradeoff where maintaining a higher running speed gives a higher chance of
   accidentally dropping the baton). To add some player interaction in a foot race,
   perhaps you'd change the theme so that the racers are robots with lasers that can shoot at one another, which suggests mechanics for shooting and dodging.
3. **Identify the conflict between players.** How can you screw up someone else's progress or accelerate yours? What's the tradeoff?
4. **Playtest.** Every time you add a mechanic to the game, test it.
   Does it make the game more fun or less fun? Does it support the core of the game? Does it work the way you originally thought it would?
5. **Create deliverable.**

## Variants
Try going through the process again and design a different game.
This time, start with the mechanics (step 2 above) and then figure out a fitting theme (step 1 above).
Notice that both ways can let you design a perfectly good game, but the thought process involved is quite different.

-----

Players are students trying to graduate. They must pass some set of courses, depending on their major.
Their major is chosen at random (as if by their parents).
They must budget their money, time, studying, and personal life.
They can do things like study, buy the books, cheat, party, get a job, etc.
These affect their resources: money, time, preparedness, and wellbeing

Money is tracked using fake dollars. It can be used to pay rent, buy food, attend social engagements, pay for courses.
Time is tracked with a slot schedule, one card can be placed on each weekday (after school activity), and two can be placed on Saturday and Sunday.
Wellbeing is measured in bottles of beer, it can be used to increase the effectiveness of their studying, do better at work (get raises), and charm their professors.
Knowledge is measured in books-read and grades earned. It can be used to pass a final, and increase the effectiveness of studying.

They traverse a fixed, circular path by rolling a seven sided die. The path is seven spaces long. A space for each day of the week.
If one player finishes the week before the others, they must wait for the others to finish the week (pass Sunday) before they can take their next turn.
Each day has a set of cards containing opportunities they may engage in, which have consequences regarding their money, time, and wellbeing.
They may choose to accept the card (apply its effect), or reject it (place it in the discard pile for that day).

Every four times around, they have a final and must pay rent and purchase books and pay tuition.
They must pass four finals to graduate. The player who graduates with the most wellbeing wins
(because grades don't actually matter, and networking is better at getting jobs than degrees are).

Some weekday cards (all cards may be declined, and may not apply)
  Money:
    Time
      On Tuesday, you work a part time job at the grocery store: Earn $200 per week.
      You skip your normal Thursday activities to participate in a student event where you win a raffle. Omit this Thursday's activity, gain $100.
    Wellbeing
      Charm your supervisor: Increase your salary by 10% in exchange for 3 bottles of beer.
    Money
      You pay a tutor $20 to study with you this Saturday morning. You learn 1 books worth of material. If you have over 5 books currently read, you learn 2 books worth of material.
  Time
    You quit your Wednesday job.
    You decide to study on Saturday evening, gain 1 book worth of knowledge.
  Wellbeing
    Whlie joking with colleagues for 2 beer bottles, you think of a great idea, saving the company money and earning a 30% raise for your Sunday morning job.
  Knowledge
    You study on Thursday for the second time this week, doubling the amount of current knowledge.

At the end of each semester (four weeks), your knowledge is reset, minus any "permanent knowledge"

Permanent knowledge is awarded in term of "golden books" they have the same implication as normal books, but they aren't reset each semester.
Golden books are received for getting good grades. Grades are achieved based on the course and the amount of current knowledge.
Generally, harder courses require more current knowledge to pass, but reward more golden books.
