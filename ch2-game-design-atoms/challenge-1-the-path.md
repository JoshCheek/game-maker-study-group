# Challenge 1: The Path (page 35)

For this game, you are going to explore the race to the end gameplay dynamic discussed earlier.
The game should allow two to four players, be about progressing on a path,
and make them go from point A to point B. The first player to point B wins.

As the game's designer, it's up to you to figure out the theme, the game bits, and the mechanics.

## Components Required
* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable
* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype or
* One-page write-up of detailing a potential game design

## Suggested Process
1. **Determine a theme and a goal.** Where are the players going,
   and why are they going there? Choose a theme that involves some interaction between the participants, to make things interesting.
2. **Identify mechanics.** Start simple. Visualize a track that goes from beginning to end that's broken up into a bunch of different sections.
   It may be 100 spaces or tiles or cards that ultimately build the track on which your players are going to "race."
   Now think of the mechanic that will get your players moving on that track. The simplest one is rolling a die.
   Next consider things you could do to make play more interesting. For instance, you could have an action that speeds you up or slows your opponent down.
   Does the narrative suggest any obvious mechanics? For example, if your game is about a relay foot race,
   you'll need a way to pass the baton (perhaps suggesting a tradeoff where maintaining a higher running speed gives a higher chance of
   accidentally dropping the baton). To add some player interaction in a foot race,
   perhaps you'd change the theme so that the racers are robots with lasers that can shoot at one another, which suggests mechanics for shooting and dodging.
3. **Identify the conflict between players.** How can you screw up someone else's progress or accelerate yours? What's the tradeoff?
4. **Playtest.** Every time you add a mechanic to the game, test it.
   Does it make the game more fun or less fun? Does it support hte core of the game? Does it work the way you originally thought it would?
5. **Create deliverable.**

## Variants
Try going through the process again and design a different game.
This time, start with the mechanics (step 2 above) and then figure out a fitting theme (step 1 above).
Notice that both ways can let you design a perfectly good game, but the thought process involved is quite different.
