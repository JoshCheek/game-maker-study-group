# Challenge 4: Pick It Up (page 38)

Walking over an object to pick it up is a phenomenally common mechanic in video games,
and leads to the collection dynamic. There are, of course, other ways to collect something.
Consider how collecting comes into play in the _Mario_ games, _Poker_, or _Bejeweled_.

For this exercise, you're going to take this mechanic and make a game out of it.
This is slightly more challenging than starting with a dynamic, which, by itself, suggests both a beginning and an ending.

You must create a game for two to four players in which players "walk" over objects and pick them up.
What players need to collect (three of a kind, similar color, and so on) and how much they need to collect is up to you.
Mecahncis that modify the primary mechanic are acceptable.
For instance, you could have players pick something up when they land on it,
or have a wheelbarrow that they first must acquire in order to pick up the objects.

You choose the theme, components, and tokens, if applicable. You may also add additional mechanics, as needed.
In particular, pay attention to the narrative. It will help as you brainstorm.
Think of this as a gardening game, then a gangster game, and then a car-racing game.
Each theme brings different possibilities into play.

## Components Required

* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable

* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype

## Suggested Process

1. **The object of the game is...** If you can't think of how to begin,
   one way is to start by naming the goal or objective that ends the game.
   This will suggest additional mechanics and dynamics for you.

   For example, if the object of the game is to have the most points when time runs out,
   it immediately gives you two more questions: how do players receive points,
   and how is time handled in the game?

   The object may be connected to a theme, so you may find it easier to develop a narrative and objective concurrently,
   or start with the theme first and then find the objective.
   For example, if you are gangsters returning from a bank heist,
   maybe the object is to keep as much money for yourself and get out before the cops show up.
2. **Identify mechanics and dynamics.** From the theme and goal, you probably already have all kinds of ideas for mechanics and dynamics in the game to support the core pick-up action. If nothing occurs to you, come up with a new theme and goal and try again.
3. **Identify the conflict between players.**
4. **Playtest.**
5. **Create deliverable.**

## Variants:

Think of another common mechanic in video games, such as shooting targets, avoiding collision with enemies, or leveling up a character. Repeat this challenge using this mechanic instead of picking up.
