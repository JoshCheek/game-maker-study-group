# Challenge 2 -- It's Mine! (page 36)

For this challenge, you'll be exploring the dynamic of territorial acquisition. If you haven't noticed already, this dynamic is present in the great majority of board games made today.

As in the previous example, this game should allow two to four players.
The game must obviously have some kind of territory which would be acquired. You may select from one of two win conditions:

* The first player to get all the territory wins
* The first player with the most territory after X turns wins.

As the game's designer, it's up to you to figure out the theme, the necessary game bits and the mechanics.

## Components Required

* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable

* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype

## Suggested Process

1. **Determine a theme, if you desire.** Precisely what are the players trying to conquer here? A swamp? A piece of the turf?
   Maybe it's a wild band of monkeys who are determined to take over the zoo at night. Remember that you don't need a theme,
   but having one often helps game designers new ot the process identify potential mechanics.
2. **Continue using the same process as in Challenge 1.**
