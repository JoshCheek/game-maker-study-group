# Challenge 3: When I Find You... (page 37)

We've talked about two common gameplay dynamics in this chapter: territorial acquisition and race to the end.
These are just two of a whole collection of dynamics, however.
Other common dynamics include building, exploration, and stomping everything in sight.

For this exercise, you will focus on the exploration dynamic.
First, consider how it is used in MMOs, adventure games, and RPGs.
In some adventure games, the "explore every locaiton" dynamic is the whole of play.
Consider how it is used in board games such as Clue.

You are tasked with creating a game that two to four individuals can play.
Since the game involves exploration, it needs some kind of space to explore, even if that space isn't a physical one.
You may use this dynamic in conjunction with another.

It will be up to you to determine the theme, mechanics, components, and additional dynamics, if any, for this exercise.

## Components Required

* Materials to create prototype

## Deliverable

* Board-game prototype or
* Card-game prototype or
* Tile-based-game prototype

## Suggested Process

1. **DEtermine a theme, if you desire.** What are the players exploring?
   Anything from a parking garage to a treetop village to downtown Chicago to a fantastical world in the sky are up for grabs.
   Think of things your player might do while exploring, too. These dynamics will give rise to the mechanics you need.
2. **Continue using the same process as in Challenge 1.**
