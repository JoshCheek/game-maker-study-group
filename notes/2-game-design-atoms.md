# Ch2: Game Design Atoms (pages 25-40)

## The game state and game views

**Game State** -- Collection of all relevant information that may change during play.

**Game View** -- Portion of the game state that a player can see (e.g. in Holdem, you can see your hole cards, the pot, and the community cards)

**Game Space** -- ?? (maybe all possible values that state can take?


## Players, avatars, and game bits

**Players** -- the agents who set the rules in motion

**Avatar** -- represents the player in the game

**Game Bits** -- physical pieces of the game (tiles, tokens, cards, board, etc)

## Mechanics

**Game Mechanics** -- All the ways to change the game state.

Common classes of mechanics:

* **Setup** -- Rules for how the game begins.
* **Victory conditions** -- Rules for how the game is won.
* **Progression of play** -- Who goes first, turn-based or real-time? etc.
* **Player actions** -- "Verbs", what players can do, and what effect those actions have on the game state.
* **Definition of the game view** -- What information a player has access to, why, how it can change over time.

## Dynamics

Pattern of play caused by mechanics (better info in ch1 notes)

Interestingly, there are also metagame dynamics, or dynamics that take place outside
of the space of the game (e.g. player alliances and StarCraft clans).


## Goals

Victory conditions, missions, quests. Often provide rewards.


## Theme

What the game is about.

> _Bohnanza_ is a game about bean farming. _Super Mario Bros._ is a game about a plumber searching through the Mushroom Kingdom to save a princess.

-- page 32

Not all games have themes, e.g. Tetris.

> _Clue_ could just as easily be about finding a lost mitten or your soul mate with exactly the same mechanics.

## What comes first?

Anything.


## Putting it all together

A nice example of the atoms and their implications (page 33).

## Challenges

### Challenge 1 -- The Path

> For this game, you are going to explore the race to the end gameplay dynamic discussed earlier.
> The game should allow two to four players, be about progressing on a path,
> and make them go from point A to point B. The first player to point B wins.
>
> As the game's designer, it's up to you to figure out the theme, the game bits, and the mechanics.
>
> #### Components Required
> * Materials to create prototype
>
> #### Deliverable
> * Board-game prototype or
> * Card-game prototype or
> * Tile-based-game prototype or
> * One-page write-up of detailing a potential game design
>
> #### Suggested Process
> 1. **Determine a theme and a goal.** Where are the players going,
>    and why are they going there? Choose a theme that involves some interaction between the participants, to make things interesting.
> 2. **Identify mechanics.** Start simple. Visualize a track that goes from beginning to end that's broken up into a bunch of different sections.
>    It may be 100 spaces or tiles or cards that ultimately build the track on which your players are going to "race."
>    Now think of the mechanic that will get your players moving on that track. The simplest one is rolling a die.
>    Next consider things you could do to make play more interesting. For instance, you could have an action that speeds you up or slows your opponent down.
>    Does the narrative suggest any obvious mechanics? For example, if your game is about a relay foot race,
>    you'll need a way to pass the baton (perhaps suggesting a tradeoff where maintaining a higher running speed gives a higher chance of
>    accidentally dropping the baton). To add some player interaction in a foot race,
>    perhaps you'd change the theme so that the racers are robots with lasers that can shoot at one another, which suggests mechanics for shooting and dodging.
> 3. **Identify the conflict between players.** How can you screw up someone else's progress or accelerate yours? What's the tradeoff?
> 4. **Playtest.** Every time you add a mechanic to the game, test it.
>    Does it make the game more fun or less fun? Does it support hte core of the game? Does it work the way you originally thought it would?
> 5. **Create deliverable.**
>
> #### Variants
> Try going through the process again and design a different game.
> This time, start with the mechanics (step 2 above) and then figure out a fitting theme (step 1 above).
> Notice that both ways can let you design a perfectly good game, but the thought process involved is quite different.


### Challenge 2 -- It's Mine!

> For this challenge, you'll be exploring the dynamic of territorial acquisition. If you haven't noticed already, this dynamic is present in the great majority of board games made today.
>
> As in the previous example, this game should allow two to four players.
> The game must obviously have some kind of territory which would be acquired. You may select from one of two win conditions:
>
> * The first player to get all the territory wins
> * The first player with the most territory after X turns wins.
>
> As the game's designer, it's up to you to figure out the theme, the necessary game bits and the mechanics.
>
> #### Components Required
>
> * Materials to create prototype
>
> #### Deliverable
>
> * Board-game prototype or
> * Card-game prototype or
> * Tile-based-game prototype
>
> #### Suggested Process
>
> 1. **Determine a theme, if you desire.** Precisely what are the players trying to conquer here? A swamp? A piece of the turf?
>    Maybe it's a wild band of monkeys who are determined to take over the zoo at night. Remember that you don't need a theme,
>    but having one often helps game designers new ot the process identify potential mechanics.
> 2. **Continue using the same process as in Challenge 1.**
